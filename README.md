Submissions for task 1A and task 1C of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events Challenge 2019 (http://dcase.community/challenge2019/task-acoustic-scene-classification).

The focus is open-set acoustic scene classification. The system consists of a combination of convolutional neural networks for closed-set identification and deep convolutional autoencoders for outlier detection.

No external data nor pretrained models have been used for our system. All neural networks are implemented with Keras and Tensorflow.
